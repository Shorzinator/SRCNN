# Single-Image Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network
#
# This project is based on a paper written by Chao Dong in 2015.
#
# Pre-requisites to using this program as is -
#   1. Create a directory named SRCNN and inside that, create three folders namely 'source', 'images', and 'output'.
#   2. Add your original and high quality images to the 'source' folder.
#   3. Upload the data set and the source code in the SRCNN folder, i.e., the main directory.
